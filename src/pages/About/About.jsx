        The objective of Aunty Wahala is to provide a space where people <br />
        from all walks of life can congregate to laugh, commiserate, vent
        <br />
        and learn from one another's experiences.

      <h1 className="title">But Why Would You Call Your Blog Aunty Wahala?</h1>
      <br />
      <p class="lines">
        Let’s break it down...
        <br />
        <br />
        Where we’re from the word “aunty” is used to address older women
        <br /> as a sign of respect. But to be clear, little kids will call a
        woman in her
        <br /> late twenties aunty, teenagers will call older women they just
        met aunty,
        <br /> and parents will call female elders aunty also. So a friend of
        our mom is
        <br /> our aunty but the lady selling street food is also called aunty.
        Still with us…?
        <br />
        The word "wahala" means trouble or problem in Yoruba but it is commonly
        <br /> used amongst people of the African diaspora.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Sidenote:</strong> We brainstormed for a while and even came up
        with Aunties with no Ozzbands (Husbands)
        <br /> as a blog name but we will not claim that in the NAMMMMEEEE OF
        JESUSSS.

        Aunty D. <br />
        <br /> Depending on the day, Aunty D is a self taught programmer (check
        out my journey in the Flip the Switch Series here)
        <br /> or she is an extrovert slowly turning into an introvert as she
        tries to live out her last year in her 20’s.
        <br /> Aunty D would be the one to completely switch careers after two
        grad programs but hey *shrugs* that's how she rolls.

        Aunty Pascale <br /> <br /> Aunty Pascale is a twenty something
        millennial who is obsessed with taking long walks, trying to balance her
        budget
        <br /> and dancing offbeat like no one is watching. Aunty Pascale is
        camera shy
        <br /> so you may not see her face but you will feel her presence
        sprinkled throughout the site.
