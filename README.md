# Aunty Wahala Blog 



## Introduction

The objective of Aunty Wahala is to provide a space where people from all walks of life can congregate to laugh, commiserate, vent and learn from one another's experiences. 

<br>
But Why Would You Call Your blog Aunty Wahala?<br><br>


<strong>Let’s break it down...</strong><br><br>


Where we’re from the word “aunty” is used to address older women as a sign of respect.But to be clear, little kids will call a woman in her late twenties aunty, teenagers will call older women they 
just met aunty, and parents will call female elders aunty also. So a friend of our mom is our aunty but the lady selling street food is also called aunty. Still with us…? The word "wahala" means trouble or problem in Yoruba but it is commonly used amongst people of the African diaspora.<br><br>

Currently, this site allows a user to sign up, log in and create a post/ suggestion. At this time they are only able to view, edit or delete posts made by them.
